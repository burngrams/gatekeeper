# datasource

datasource is a desktop apps that maps data sources to files.

For example, npm i datasource-google-drive and adding a script to ~/Desktop/datasource that uses the primitives that datsource provides, such as FileList.

datasource will handle authentication, making sure the data is up to date.

you get a FUSE like, tabFS-esque, files that represent your data source for use in commandline and elsewhere.

datasource could be used to offload a bunch of bureaucracy that makes it simpler to write programs that do stuff with your cloud data. it opens up a bunch of use cases that today would be deemed to complex to that part.

small step for FUSE fans, big step for libery of data - lets free ur data from the cloud.
